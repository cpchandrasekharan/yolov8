!mkdir {HOME}/datasets
Once the directory is created, we will navigate into it to perform further operations. To change the current directory to the newly created "datasets" directory, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
%cd {HOME}/datasets
Now, we need to unzip the contents of the "data" folder into the "datasets" directory. Assuming you have a compressed file named "data.zip" that contains the "data" folder, you can unzip it using the appropriate command for your system. For example, on Linux, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
!unzip /path/to/data.zip -d {HOME}/datasets
This command will extract the contents of "data.zip" into the "datasets" directory
a. Open the file explorer on your local machine.
b. Navigate to the location where the "data.yaml" file is stored.
c. Locate the "data" folder within the "datasets" directory on the left side of the file explorer.
d. Drag and drop the "data.yaml" file from your local machine into the "data" folder in the file explorer.
By following these steps, you will successfully create a directory named "datasets," unzip the "data" folder into it, and upload the "data.yaml" file inside the "data" folder located at "/content/datasets/data/data.yaml".
